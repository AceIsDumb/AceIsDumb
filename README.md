## About me 🤗

Hello 👋 I'm Chace, a secondary 4 student from the School of Science and Technology, and a frontend web and native developer.

In 2024, I was the ACTO@SST Inc. where I taught my juniors React Native. I also went for many courses to sharpen my skills in development.

I enjoy networking with like minded individuals, with a passion about development and artificial intelligence. Between my studies and working on my portfolio, I'm either playing guitar or working on side projects.

If you'd like to contact me, go ahead and drop me a connection request and we can have a chat!
